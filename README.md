## Guidelines for developing badge-based content within a modular learning system.

**Purpose**

The overarching goal is to achieve *modularity* across all learning paths of a curriculum for the purpose of customized implementation and efficient continual maintenance. It systematically organizes *what* will be taught, *who* will be taught, and *how* it will be taught in a repeatable, consistent pattern.

The basic idea of modularity is that at all levels there should be the opportunity to choose and combine modules in different ways according to the context of each particular teaching situation.

**What is a Module?**

A module is an autonomous block of content based on a limited set of objectives designed to instruct, inform, quantify and qualify the proficiency level of a student within a given domain.

Modules are the basis in which badges are issued.

**What is a Badge?**

A badge is digital representation of an accomplishment, interest or affiliation that is **visual** and **available online**.

You earn badges by completing modules.

A "Module" can be further defined as:

- A set of clearly identifiable and certifiable portion of the curriculum, expressed in terms of objectives
- A block of content that always remains in context to the module's objectives and isolated from others
- A block of content that is contextualized to personas, prioritization and a minimum difficulty level
- Objectives should be achieved within a clear and realistic time limit (20 minutes)
- Objectives that contains a maximum of 2 learning paths

Modules help to:

- Shorten the time to competency
- Document procedures, best practices and use cases
- Standardize objectives across multiple skill levels and personas
- Automate curriculum development for on-going maintenance

## How to Modularize?

Modularity is achieved by "compartmentalizing" content areas into bite-sized manageable training content that can be separated and delivered as a standalone unit, or recombined into a customized training course, for either on-demand or instructor-led initiatives.

### Components

The following key components of a module that help define its requirements and structure:

- Difficulty
- Personas
- Objectives
- Storyline
- Demos
- Polls
- Exams
- Resources (*optional: for each persona*)


#### Difficulty

This is the minimum skill level that you feel is appropriate for a given module.  There are 3 levels, please choose highest level:

1. Beginner (core)
2. Intermediate (features)
3. Advanced (optimization / automation)

#### Personas

There are 4 personas that we are targeting for SP Learning:

- **CTO**: "Nico: Technology decision maker - He started the company, it’s his baby. He’s about moving fast but also building something for the long term. He wants to make sure the team has control over their platform and code. The risk is on him so he wants technologies he can trust, especially when it comes to security and privacy."
- **Biz**: "A.C.: Business - When more focus on the product was needed, Nico hired him. He’s all about velocity like London. He wants products in customers’ hands as fast as possible, and whatever technologies help with that, he likes. He is always monitoring the services and going through data to try to understand his customers better."
- **Dev**: "London: Developer - While her main job is development, she also does a little monitoring of the service and used to do all the Ops work before Astro. She’s all about velocity. She’d rather get something good enough and out the door than perfect. Platforms, libraries, code, and documentation have to be easy to use and learn to keep moving fast. If something’s new and promising, she’s going to check it out."
- **Ops**: "Astro: Ops - He joined after the dev workload got too large for Nico and London. He’s in charge of pushing new releases, any “tests” they run, and is the point person if the service goes down. He’s the one with the pager. He wants to know everything about the health of the service and the details of any code they write. Everything should be scriptable. If a platform, library, or some code is proven and stable, he’d prefer they use that to the shiny new thing."

#### Objectives

There are 3 logical components that are used to define a specification, or ontology, of a module:

- **Definitions**: keywords and axioms that associate the names of entities in the universe of discourse.  These terms are common vocabulary in which shared knowledge is represented and systematically resolved against.

	*"Students should be able to define..."*

- **Concepts**: concepts definitions, classes, relations and function terms that are focused on an intuitive representation of knowledge.

	*"Students should be able to explain..."*

- **Actions**: specific tasks or assignments that help to enforce the understanding of concepts.

	*"Students should be able to do..."*

#### Storyline / Narrative

A chain, or thread, of communication teach objectives to specific personas.  It's not meant to be displayed to a learner, rather it aids the instructor in understanding flow and organizing content. This can be particularly helpful with assisting with train-the-trainer activities.

#### Slides

Presentation files are the visual representation of narratives and objectives.

Slides should consist of:

- Stories that engages audience;
- Questions to ask and how to ask questions;
- Media assets that help understand;

#### Demonstrations

"Proof or evidence" actions and examples that validate or help support the objectives and knowledge transfer.

#### Anecdotes

Short and amusing or interesting stories that help establish relevance between the content and the student.  Anecdotes are provided for each of the personas as part of the module content.

#### Polls

Assessments that quantify learning learning path and bridge between objectives and narratives.

#### Exams

Pool of exam questions that are isolated to the scope of a module.

#### Resources

Additional assets for personas and skill levels.  This includes train-the-trainer videos and internal portal.

## The process:

1. Assign all definitions that are related to a Topic:

	- a. Assign a value for the minimum difficulty (or proficiency level) that is expected of the user
	- b. Mark each persona that may have a vested stake in this topic
	- c. Review each definition (line by line) as a team and verify difficulty and roles are appropriate.

2. Define Topic Concepts

	- a. Core Concepts
	- b. Feature Concepts
	- c. Optimization Concepts

3. Map Definitions to Concepts:

4. Generate Modules:

	1. Beginner: What are the core concepts?
	2. Intermediate: What are the key features?
	3. Advanced: How do you optimize and scale?
